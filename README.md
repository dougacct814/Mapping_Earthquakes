# Mapping Earthquakes!

## Challenge Assignment 13:

Challenge assignment was to add a third map style as an additional tile layer. Also add tectonic plate GeoJSON data to the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.

### GOALS

 - Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
 - Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
 - Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
 - Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
